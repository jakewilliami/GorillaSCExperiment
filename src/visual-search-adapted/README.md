# Visual Search &mdash; Variable Grid Density

This experiment was like [the original visual search](../visual-search/), with some differences:
  - Target could be either face, pariedolia, or car;
  - Grid size is always 8x8;
  - Variable number of image within the grid (16, 24, 36); the rest of the grid is blank.
