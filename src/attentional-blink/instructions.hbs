        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>In this experiment, you will see a grid of images. Your task is to find a particular image (target image) in the grid of images as quickly as possible. The target image category will either be a face, an object that looks like a face, or a car. Examples of each of these target images are shown below.</p>
        <p>You will be told throughout the experiment which target image to search for. Sometimes a target image will be present in the grid and sometimes there will be no target image. Please make your response by using two different fingers from the same hand. </p>
        <p>Before the experiment begins there will be several practice trials. Click the <kbd>Next</kbd> button when you are ready to proceed to the practice instructions.</p>
