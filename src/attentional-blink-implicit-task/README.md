# Attentional Blink &mdash; Implicit Task

This experiment is based on [the original attentional blink experiment](../attentional-blink), with some changes:
  - T1 can now be either a face, a pariedolia face, or a watch (no distinction between digital or analogue);
  - T2 is always a flower;
  - There is no T1-related question;
  - Only lags 3 and 7 are allowed between T1 and T2 images (previously lag 1 was allowed).
