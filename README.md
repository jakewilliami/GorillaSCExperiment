## Policy Decision

All images are in a `Stimuli` directory.  Distractors have names `D<num>.jpg`; Faces, `F<num>.jpg`; etc. (for `C`, `HF`, and `LF` as well).  This is an important step in the randomisation process, because instead of randomly pulling an image from the directory, we randomly pull a number from a list of numbers, and then add (for example) `D` to the start, and `.jpg` to the end.
